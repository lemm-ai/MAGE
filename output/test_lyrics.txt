Genre: pop
Theme: love and dreams

==================================================

Dancing with and, come what may
Lost in love, so far away
Through the heart, night and day
I feel the hope, burning flame
Lost in party, so far away
In the dreams, I find my way
Through the party, night and day
Dancing with light, come what may
Dancing with time, come what may
In the feel, I find my way
Lost in dreams, so far away
When the soul calls my name
